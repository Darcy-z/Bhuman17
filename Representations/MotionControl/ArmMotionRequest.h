header: Everything that can be part of a class body except for the attributes that should
be streamable and the default constructor. Please note that this part must not contain
commas that are not surrounded by parentheses, because C++ would consider it to be
more than a single macro parameter otherwise. A workaround is to use the macro COMMA
instead of an actual comma. However, the use of that macro should be avoided if possible,
e. g. by defining constructors with comma-separated initializer lists outside of the structâ€™s
body.
